# LSTM-GRU-AMZN
Creating and testing LSTM and GRU models with Amazon stock price data. 

The purpose of this project is to understand and build LSTM and GRU models.
In the future, I have plans to pull actionable insights from these two models, such as forecasting future AMZN stock prices.

The ***LSTM.md*** and ***GRU.md*** are the main files of the project and showcase my coding and presentation.
